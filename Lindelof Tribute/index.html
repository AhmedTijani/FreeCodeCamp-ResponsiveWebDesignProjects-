            Victor Lindelof found it tough to adapt to the Premier League. However, the Swede has gradually established
            himself as Manchester United's strongest centre-back and an undisputed backline leader.
            <br>
            Thus, it's even more surprising to know the 25-year-old was not always a defender. The Iceman himself has
            revealed to ESPN:
            <br>
            "I was a midfielder when I was young. I haven't been a defender for long. I think maybe that's why I am
            comfortable on the ball because I started as a No. 10, then a two-way midfielder, then a No. 6 and now I'm a
            defender. Maybe that's why I like to have the ball and why I'm comfortable with it.
            <br>
            "I like to have the ball at my feet. I'm comfortable with it. That's not a problem for me and I like to play
            football that way.
            <br>
            "When I was younger, I scored a lot of goals. I don't score a lot of goals now. It was fun to play as a No.
            10. I could do whatever I wanted.
            <br>
            "But I was young, maybe 13. It was fun. In my head sometimes I'm still a No. 10. I like to pass. I don't
            have that instinct any more of shooting. Now I'd rather set up my teammates for a goal."
